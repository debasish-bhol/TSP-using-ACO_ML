# TSP-using-ACO_ML
This project is based on Ant colony optimization algorithm.
Ant Colony Optimization: 
Ant colony optimization (ACO) is a population-based metaheuristic that can be used to find approximate solutions to difficult optimization problems.
Travelling Salesman Problem:
The travelling salesman problem (TSP) asks the following question: "Given a list of cities and the distances between each pair of cities, what is the shortest possible route that visits each city and returns to the origin city?" ... It is used as a benchmark for many optimization methods.
